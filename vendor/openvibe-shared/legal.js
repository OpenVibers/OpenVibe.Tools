// openvibe-shared/legal — Terms, Privacy and DMCA for every OpenVibe site.
//
// Each domain answers for itself: /terms, /privacy and /dmca live on the site's own apex and say
// what THAT site does. One template per document, with clauses switched by the site's profile:
//   streaming  live video, chat, payments      tools    files processed, then deleted
//   ugc        posts, pastes, comments          games    accounts and game state
//   hosting    stored user media                account  the identity provider
//   info       read-only / placeholder site
//
//   const legal = require('openvibe-shared/legal');
//   app.get(legal.PATHS, legal.handler({ host: 'openvibe.tools', name: 'OpenVibe.Tools', profile: 'tools' }));
//   legal.page('privacy', site) → complete HTML document (static generators use this)
//
// Plain language on purpose. These are templates maintained by the project, not legal advice;
// the owner reviews them before relying on them. Facts stated here (what is stored, for how
// long) must match the code — change both together.
